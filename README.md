# dynapi
A dynamic API allowing for easy testing

## Todo

- [x] Add the parsed template to the route config and perform a manual equals (template not comparable)
- [x] url.Query parameters should result in "1, 2", not "[1 2]"
- [ ] Plumb in facebookgo/clock and get tests working (currently getting deadlocks)
